<p>The Rocky Mountain Women’s Film Festival is the longest continuous-running women's film&nbsp;festival in North America. It showcases documentary, feature, short and animated&nbsp;films that are thought-provoking and enriching, and that encourage global awareness&nbsp;and personal growth. The Rocky Mountain Women’s Film Festival honors films and&nbsp;filmmakers that present the world as women experience it and that inspire curiosity,&nbsp;educate, entertain, and stimulate conversation.</p><p>The Rocky Mountain Women’s Film Festival was the brainchild of Donna Guthrie and&nbsp;Jere Martin. After attending the Telluride Film Festival in 1986, Jere says&nbsp;they were inspired&nbsp;to “create a film festival of our own, centered on women’s stories; whether it was a film&nbsp;about a woman or a film by a woman, with a great passion for some subject.”</p><p>The community whole-heartedly embraced the Rocky Mountain Women’s Film Festival&nbsp;and twenty-five years later the festival employs an Executive Director, relies on almost&nbsp;forty volunteers and welcomes over 1,000 people to their 3-day festival each November.</p><p>The Rocky Mountain Women's Film Festival (RMWFF) is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt non-profit organization. All donations to RMWFF are generally deductible for federal income tax purposes, except that the fair market value of goods and services received&nbsp;with the donation must often be excluded from the deduction.&nbsp; RMWFF generally provides information concerning the fair market value of tickets, food and drink, and other goods and services provided to donors in connection with its fundraising activities.</p>
